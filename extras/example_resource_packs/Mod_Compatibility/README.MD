# Mod Compatibility
MiEx has support for modded worlds. It contains a tool to extract a resource pack from a mod pack, where the resource pack contains the needed files for MiEx to know how to export out the modded blocks. Unfortunately, some mods have blocks or biomes that are partially or entirely handled in code, rather than resource pack files, and MiEx then can't extract that data. This means that we need to manually add in those missing files. This resource pack is meant to provide those missing files for a bunch of different mods. The goal is that everyone can help contribute to it to add in support for more mods and to update the support for existing mods.

## Supported mods
Here is a list of all mods that this resource pack has support added for, including what it specifically adds:
#### Yuushya Modelling
* Adds support for the Show Block.
