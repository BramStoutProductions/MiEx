# Usage
When the addon is installed you can prep the imported world by selecting the `world Empty`, opening the search bar (default hotkey: `f3`) and then look for `miex.prep`. You can prep the materials and also add basic texture animations for campfire and others. The implementation for the animation is very basic and does not support correct animation speeds automatically. This will might come later in more updated versions of this addon and MiEx. There is also an option for resizing the world to a more reasonable scale for minecraft characters.
