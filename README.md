MiEx is a modern Minecraft World Exporter written in Java, originally created for use by Bram Stout Productions to help create sets for animations. It has also been used for animations in Minecraft Live and Element Animation videos. MiEx exports out worlds into USD (Universal Scene Description).

# Features
* Uses Minecraft's Resource Pack system for an accurate export of the world, and allowing it to export with custom resource packs (including custom models).
* Support for modded worlds.
* Exports worlds out into big chunks (called export chunks) which each are payloaded into your scene, allowing you to only load in specific parts of the world when animating, so that the world won't slow down your computer.
* Level-of-Detail system to reduce polygon count in the far background, making it feasable to have massive sets.
* Remove caves feature to reduce polygon count.
* Ability to export certain blocks as a new instance for each occurence of the block, making it easy to replace those block (like a chest or a door) with a rig of the block.
* Up to 3x faster rendering with ray tracers (like Renderman, Arnold, Redshift, and Cycles) due to a custom made raytracing optimiser.
* Face optimiser that combines faces into larger faces, whenever possible, in order to reduce polycount.
* Powerful material templating system.
* Support for pipeline integration.
* Option to separate the world out into a foreground section and a background section.
* Custom random noise generator for block model selection to make randomly rotated textures appear nicer to the eye.
* Support for maps in item frames.
* Support for biome colours, including biome blending.
* Support for animated textures.
* Support for random frame offsets on animated textures.
* Support for grouping textures together into atlases in order to reduce material count.
* Support for adding a random offset to certain blocks (like vegetation) to reproduce what happens in Minecraft.
* Support for connected textures using Optifine's CTM format.
* ***Currently not yet implemented, but groundwork laid out for:*** Potential support for Minecraft Bedrock worlds.

MiEx currently supports worlds from Minecraft 21w43a and later.

# Installing
MiEx is released as a stand-alone Jar file which contains all that it needs. The base resource pack files are automatically gathered from the latest version of Minecraft that is installed on your computer. All that you have to do, is download the Jar file, place it wherever you want (preferably in its own folder), and run it. You can get the latest release [here.](https://github.com/BramStoutProductions/MiEx/releases)
